## Currently Under Development
### <For Work In Progress(WIP), please check "Feature" branches>


#### Purpose of the Application


This is the first WPF application am building to learn the same.

This is a tiny utility appliation to store the list of temporarily usable files/folders which may not be needed anymore in future. If these files/folders gets mixed with other, sometimes it might take more time to find these files to delete inorder to free-up the storage. So, whenever you decide certain files/folders is not needed in future, simply put/mark it in this tiny application. The files to be deleted can be categorized, and shows number of files and total size of a category. So, whenever you decide to delete some files to free-up some space, just open RTFTDIF application decide which category to delete as you have already marked the files to delete, its as simple as thaat. In simple words, its just like a notes taking application with simple inbuilt functions to delete those files from within the application.
